## 3. Website Copy — Key Pages

### 3.1 About Us Page

**Hero:**
```
Building Africa's Electric Future, One Vehicle at a Time
```

**Our Story:**
```
autoexports.live was founded with a clear mission: to democratize access 
to electric vehicles across Africa. We recognized that while the world 
was rapidly transitioning to electric mobility, African buyers faced 
significant barriers — limited inventory, complex import procedures, 
and lack of transparent pricing.

Our team brings together expertise in automotive auctions, international 
logistics, and the African import landscape. We've built relationships 
with Chinese EV manufacturers and developed streamlined processes that 
turn the complex journey of importing an electric vehicle into a 
seamless experience.

Today, AutoExports is the trusted platform for buyers across Nigeria and 
growing markets in Ghana, Kenya, and South Africa. We're not just 
selling vehicles — we're powering Africa's sustainable mobility revolution.
```

**Our Values:**
```
Transparency
Every cost, every process, every timeline is clearly communicated. 
No surprises, no hidden fees.

Sustainability
We believe electric mobility is essential for Africa's future. 
Every EV we help import is a step toward cleaner air and reduced 
dependence on imported fuel.

Excellence
From vehicle inspection to final delivery, we maintain the highest 
standards. Our 98.7% customer satisfaction rate reflects our 
commitment to getting every detail right.

Accessibility
Whether you're buying your first vehicle or adding to a fleet, 
our platform is designed to serve buyers at every level.

### 3.5 EV Knowledge Center

**Page Title:** "Your Electric Vehicle Education Hub"

**Section: Understanding EV Battery Health**
```
The battery is the heart of any electric vehicle, and understanding 
its condition is crucial when buying used or imported EVs.

WHAT IS STATE OF HEALTH (SoH)?
State of Health represents the current capacity of a battery compared 
to its original capacity. A battery at 90% SoH can hold 90% of the 
energy it could when new.

WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
• 95-100% SoH: Excellent condition, near-new performance
• 85-94% SoH: Good condition, normal aging
• 70-84% SoH: Fair condition, noticeable range reduction
• Below 70%: Consider battery replacement costs

Every AutoExports listing includes a certified battery health report 
from our inspection partners.
```

**Section: Charging in Nigeria**
```
