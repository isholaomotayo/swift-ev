─────────────────────────────────────

1. GETTING STARTED

Creating Your Account

AutoAuctions Africa is open to everyone, but bidding requires 
a verified account. Here's how to get started:

Step 1: Register
Visit our registration page and select your account type:
• Individual Buyer — For personal vehicle purchases
• Dealer/Reseller — For licensed car businesses
• Corporate/Fleet — For companies buying multiple vehicles
• Seller — For those listing vehicles for sale

Step 2: Verify Your Identity
Complete our KYC (Know Your Customer) verification:
• Upload a valid government-issued ID
• Provide proof of address (optional but recommended)
• For dealers: Upload business registration and dealer license
• Pay the one-time $3 verification fee

Step 3: Fund Your Wallet
Before you can bid, your wallet must contain at least 10% of 
the vehicle's current bid value. This ensures only serious 
bidders participate and maintains auction integrity.

Browsing Without an Account

You don't need an account to:
• Browse all vehicle listings
• View auction schedules
• Check sample fees and pricing
• Research vehicles and sellers

However, to place bids, you must register and verify.

─────────────────────────────────────

2. UNDERSTANDING THE AUCTION

This Is Competition, Not Shopping

AutoAuctions Africa is not a marketplace with fixed prices. 
It's a competitive auction where buyers compete against each 
other in real-time. This creates:

• Fair market pricing through transparent competition
• Opportunity to win vehicles below market value
• Excitement and engagement in the buying process

Auction Types

Live Auctions
Real-time bidding events where buyers compete head-to-head. 
Our 60-second rule ensures fair competition — each new bid 
resets a 60-second timer. The auction only ends when no new 
bids are placed within 60 seconds.

Buy Now
Some vehicles have a fixed "Buy Now" price set by the seller. 
You can purchase immediately at this price. However, if the 
vehicle isn't purchased before its scheduled auction date, 
it enters live bidding.

Reserve Price
Sellers may set a minimum price they'll accept. If bidding 
doesn't reach this reserve, the seller can choose to accept, 
reject, or counter the highest bid.

Vehicle Statuses

• New Listing — Recently added, not yet in auction
• Upcoming Auction — Scheduled for future live bidding
• Live Auction — Currently accepting bids
• Ending Soon — Less than 24 hours remaining
• Sold — Auction complete, winner confirmed
• Buy Now Available — Can be purchased immediately

─────────────────────────────────────

3. BIDDING BASICS

Pre-Bidding

Before a live auction begins, you can place pre-bids:
• Smaller increments allowed (e.g., ₦25,000)
• Helps gauge interest and set starting prices
• Your pre-bid becomes active when live auction starts

Live Bidding

During live auctions:
• Larger increments required (e.g., ₦100,000)
• Real-time competition with other bidders
• 60-second rule: Each bid resets the timer
• Auction ends when timer expires with no new bids

Max Bid (Proxy Bidding)

Set a maximum amount you're willing to pay:
• System automatically bids for you
• Only bids the minimum needed to stay ahead
• Never exceeds your maximum
• You remain anonymous to other bidders

Example: You set a max bid of ₦20,000,000. If the current 
bid is ₦15,000,000, the system bids ₦15,100,000 for you. 
It continues bidding on your behalf up to your maximum.

Bid Requirements

• Wallet balance must be ≥10% of bid amount
• All bids are binding — no withdrawals
• You must pay if you win
• Outbid notifications sent via app, email, and SMS

   6. Complete KYC by uploading your ID
   7. Fund your wallet to start bidding

Q: What is the bidding deposit requirement?
A: Your wallet balance must be at least 10% of any vehicle's 
value that you wish to bid on. This ensures only serious 
bidders participate. For example, to bid on a ₦20,000,000 
vehicle, you need at least ₦2,000,000 in your wallet.

During our promotional period, we offer a flat ₦100,000 
deposit requirement for new members.

Q: Can I withdraw a bid once placed?
A: No. All bids are binding and cannot be withdrawn. When 
you place a bid, you're making a commitment to purchase 
the vehicle if you win. Please bid carefully.

Q: How does the 60-second rule work?
A: During live auctions, each new bid resets a 60-second 
countdown timer. The auction continues as long as bids 
keep coming within each 60-second window. The auction 
only ends when 60 seconds passes with no new bids. 
This prevents "sniping" and ensures fair competition.

Q: What is a Max Bid (Proxy Bidding)?
A: A Max Bid allows you to set the maximum amount you're 
willing to pay. Our system automatically bids on your 
behalf, always using the minimum increment needed to 
stay ahead of other bidders. It never exceeds your 
maximum. This is useful when you can't monitor the 
auction in real-time.

Q: What happens after I win an auction?
A: 1. You receive instant notification of your win
   2. An invoice is generated with full breakdown
   3. You have 72 hours to complete payment
   4. Select any additional services (shipping, clearing, etc.)
   5. Track your vehicle through delivery

Q: What if I can't pay within 72 hours?
A: Late payment results in:
• ₦50,000 late fee + 2% of invoice total
• Daily storage fees (₦10,000/day)
• Account suspension risk
• Deposit forfeiture (in case of non-payment)

Please only bid on vehicles you intend to purchase.

Q: How do I track my vehicle after purchase?
A: Your dashboard includes a real-time tracking section showing:
• Current location and status
• Shipping milestones
• Estimated arrival dates
• Document processing status
• Photos at each stage

Q: What if the vehicle is not as described?
A: Report issues within 24-72 hours through our Dispute Center. 
Upload evidence (photos, videos, documents) and our team will 
review the case. Outcomes may include refund, partial refund, 
repair credit, or claim rejection based on evidence.

─────────────────────────────────────
SELLERS
─────────────────────────────────────

Q: How do I list a vehicle for sale?
A: 1. Register as a seller
   2. Complete business verification (for dealers)
   3. Click "Add Vehicle" in your dashboard
   4. Enter all vehicle details
   5. Upload required photos and videos
   6. Upload ownership documents
   7. Choose selling method and set pricing
   8. Submit for review

Q: Can I set a Buy Now price?
A: Yes. You can set a fixed "Buy Now" price for immediate 
purchase. However, if the vehicle isn't sold before its 
scheduled auction date, it automatically enters live 
bidding where the final price is determined by competition.

Q: What is a reserve price?
A: A reserve price is the minimum amount you're willing to 
accept. If bidding doesn't reach your reserve, you can 
choose to accept the highest bid, reject it, or make 
a counter-offer to the highest bidder.

Q: Do I have to accept the final bid?
A: If the final bid meets or exceeds your reserve price 
(or falls within your agreed margin), yes, you must 
accept and complete the sale. This ensures buyer 
confidence in the auction process.

Q: How do I get paid after a sale?
A: 1. Buyer completes payment into escrow
   2. You receive notification to release the vehicle
   3. Buyer or logistics collects the vehicle
   4. You confirm release in your dashboard
   5. Escrow releases funds to your bank account
   6. Payout arrives within 24-48 hours

Q: What fees do sellers pay?
A: • Listing fee: Free (promotional) / ₦10,000 standard
   • Success fee: 6-8% of final sale price (only if sold)
   • Featured listing: ₦25,000 (optional)

Q: What happens if I misrepresent a vehicle?
A: Misrepresentation has serious consequences:
• First offense: ₦100,000 fine + listing removed
• Second offense: ₦500,000 + 30-day suspension
• Third offense: Permanent ban
Always be honest and accurate in your listings.

─────────────────────────────────────
PAYMENTS & SECURITY

TRUST & SAFETY

At AutoAuctions Africa, trust is the foundation of every transaction. 
We've built comprehensive systems to protect buyers, sellers, and 
the integrity of our auction marketplace.

─────────────────────────────────────

ESCROW PROTECTION

Every payment is secured through escrow.

How It Works:
1. Buyer wins auction and makes payment
2. Funds held securely by Flutterwave (our escrow partner)
3. Seller releases vehicle to buyer or logistics
4. Buyer confirms receipt
5. Escrow releases funds to seller

This protects:
• Buyers from paying without receiving vehicle
• Sellers from releasing without receiving payment
• Both parties from fraud

─────────────────────────────────────

VERIFICATION BADGES

Transactions are scored for risk factors and suspicious 
activities are blocked or flagged for review.

Seller Performance Tracking
Sellers are rated based on accuracy, timeliness, and 
buyer satisfaction. Poor performers face restrictions.
